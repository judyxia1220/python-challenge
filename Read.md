Python Challenge

What's included:
    2 folders that each have a .py file containing codes for solving the assingments.

Resources:
1. https://www.w3schools.com/python/default.asp
    I practiced a lot with this site and its subsites on basic syntax memorization. Using this site as a reference, I managed to have a better understanding on how to use the ".append" function in python. I also learned a lot of different syntax to calculate and format the output such as through the  "len" function in the PyBank code. I used this for both the PyBank and PyPoll code. 

2. Class Activities:
    The class activities helped me have a better understanding on how to write the code for creating new files throught the write function. My understanding from the logic behind the use of "for loops" and "if/then statements" from VBS were also helpful for writing both codes for PyBank and PyPoll
